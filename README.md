### Examples

### How to use

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import tactJs from 'tact-js'

tactJs.submit();
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript

tactJs.addListener(function(msg) {
    if (msg.status === 'Connected') {
        console.log('connected');
    }
});

var points = [{
    Index : 10,
    Intensity : 100
}];
tactJs.submitDot('dot', 'VestFront', points, 1000);
```
